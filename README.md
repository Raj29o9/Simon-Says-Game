Welcome to the Simon Says game! This project is a digital version of the classic memory game where players must replicate sequences of colors.

◾ Introduction:-

          The Simon Says game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors.
          Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, increasing the difficulty.
          The game continues until the player makes a mistake.
